        <h1>Per Capita Water Supply in Yadgir District</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Access to safe and clean drinking water is essential for the health and well-being of individuals, communities, and nations. In rural areas of India, however, drinking water quality is often compromised due to various factors such as poor infrastructure, lack of treatment facilities, and contamination from agricultural and industrial activities.</p>
            <p>Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) guidelines state that every rural household must have access to equitable (55 lpcd) and potable drinking water (IS 10500:2012) by 2024. Implementing effective monitoring and surveillance systems is crucial to identifying and addressing water quality issues. This article outlines a framework for drinking water quality monitoring and surveillance in rural households at the village level for efficient implementation and achieving the goals of JJM.</p>

            LPCD of 55 is necessary for the villages under JJM to be eligible for certification. <br>
            Here is the analysis of LPCD Distribution for each block in the ranges. <br>
            I have taken four ranges: (0-20)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(20-40)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(40-55)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(55+) <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Majority of blocks</span> have achieved decent LPCD values, with most in the range of 40-55 LPCD. However, some additional effort is required to reach the 55+ LPCD benchmark across all villages.  
            </li>
        
            <li>  
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shorapur block</span> has performed exceptionally well by covering over 55+ LPCD in a significant number of villages. This success can serve as a model for other blocks.
            </li>
        
            <li>
            <span style="color: #d9534f;">Yadgir block</span> is concerning, with 0 villages reaching 55+ LPCD supply. Focused initiatives likely needed to improve coverage in this block. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
            With some targeted efforts, most blocks can attain 55+ LPCD supply. Monitoring village-level data also allows identifying and assisting villages with the greatest need.
