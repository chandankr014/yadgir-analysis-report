            <p>Access to safe and clean drinking water is essential for the health and well-being of individuals, communities, and nations. In rural areas of India, however, drinking water quality is often compromised due to various factors such as poor infrastructure, lack of treatment facilities, and contamination from agricultural and industrial activities.</p>
            <p>Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) guidelines state that every rural household must have access to equitable (55 lpcd) and potable drinking water (IS 10500:2012) by 2024. Implementing effective monitoring and surveillance systems is crucial to identifying and addressing water quality issues. This article outlines a framework for drinking water quality monitoring and surveillance in rural households at the village level for efficient implementation and achieving the goals of JJM.</p>
